# Vex-Blog-Live

Website for the laptop refurbishment club that I ran

## Contents
- Section of the site exists as a 'blog' that we can add articles to (usually from ifixit) to show people how to fix the new batch of laptops
- Other section of the site uses the django backend and sqllite3 database to store lots of useful data about each laptop as it's fixed. Each entry is tied to an account so you know who to talk to if something is wrong

## Download and run
- You will need django 2.x.x and python 3.x.x
- Download the file to your local machine, and on terminal navigate to 'manage.py' then run the command 'manage.py runserver'
